## Summary
There are nine pillars to building and sustaining a DevOps value driven organization. The journey is not complete until all are part of the engineering practice. 

### Leadership 
  Leaders set an inspiring DevOps directional vision for the organization, and proactively stimulate and sponsor team activities that help progress toward goals

### Collaborative culture 
  The organization encourages cross-functional collaboration, shared responsibilities and works to reduce restrictive boundaries between organizational functions.

### Design for DevOps
  Products are architected to support service-oriented, modular, independent packaging, testing and releases, in accordance with the principles of twelve-factor apps.

### Continuous integration 
  Changes to software code and artifacts needed for releases are frequently merged, built, tested and packaged into executable artifacts for application releases.

### Continuous testing 
  Software tests that are most important to verify the results of pipeline stages including pre-flight, integration, regression, performance and release acceptance tests are automated as much as possible.

### Elastic infrastructure 
  Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) resources (i.e., software, computing machines, storage and networks) are integrated into a tool chain for automating builds and testing environments to efficiently support variable workload demands.

### Continuous monitoring 
  Applications, pipeline tools and infrastructure components are instrumented with metrics, and the collected data is analyzed to manage health and performance.

### Continuous security (DevSecOps) 
  Security practices, processes and technologies for applications, databases, pipelines and infrastructures are integrated into the culture and pipelines to assure security.

### Continuous delivery 
  Release artifacts are validated, prepared for deployment to production and may be automatically deployed to production once acceptable deployment measures are achieved.

## But wait, there's more 
  As the DevOps framework is being implemented, continue to define following principles. As the organization evolves, these principles will be important to the functions of the practice. 

  **Version management systems** – Every stage in the end-to-end DevOps value stream depends on keeping track of versions of software source code, configuration data and executable images using source code management systems, artifact repositories and configuration management systems.

  **Infrastructure-as-a-Service** – Virtualised cloud and dedicated resources must be served up ephemerally to meet variable workload and storage demands, which requires mastering engineering practices for orchestrating dedicated and cloud, hybrid cloud and multicloud services, and deployment of applications to the infrastructure.

  DevOps pipeline practices, which constitute a layer just above the nine core practices, include two additional categories that make use of the nine core DevOps practices.

  **Application release** automation – Directing and monitoring software changes through the CI/CD pipeline requires process orchestration and data analysis working at a level above the CI/CD pipeline itself.

  **Value stream management** – A deployed service, composed of multiple application microservices and data services, requires orchestration and analysis of a federated set of services, end-to-end, across the value stream from planning through to operations.

### Management and Administrative Practices
  DevOps Service Management practices include four Pipeline sub practices practices:

  **Service catalogs** – Organized collections of software stacks, tools and pre-configured pipelines, made available through portals, enable DevOps-as-a-Service operations and simplify access, configuration, control and evolution of DevOps resources needed by enterprise application teams.

  **Disaster prevention and recovery** – Proactive disaster monitoring coupled with high-availability configurations and disaster mitigation practices, such as automated processes, work together to minimize the blast radius of disastrous events, and orchestrate rapid restoration of essential DevOps services, when needed.

  **Site reliability engineering (SRE)** – A combination of practices which include service level objectives (SLOs), error
  budgets, monitoring,paring policies, toil reduction, proactive anti-fragility practices and blameless post-mortems help to “shift left” production wisdom from operations into development, thus improving the efficiency, readiness, security and resiliency of applications and infrastructures in production.

  **Governance** – The scale and scope of enterprise DevOps solutions are controlled using governance policies-as-code implemented through service catalogs, management dashboards and error budget policies.

### Project Practices
  DevOps project practices include four categories that guide enterprise adoption and evolution of DevOps, as follows:

  **Adoption** – Enterprise-wide DevOps adoption strategies that engineer and build DevOps capabilities in logical phases. This begins with a small set of representative applications that serve as a model for other applications; this method has been shown to be more successful than “boil the ocean” strategies that attempt to transform all applications at the same time.

  **Model Applications** – that serve as a model for greater enterprise adoption – are selected and monitored according to criterion that spotlight the value of DevOps for other applications.

  **Return on investment** (ROI) – DevOps investments must compete with other IT projects for resources. An ROI model that demonstrates measurable cost savings is an approach that has proved to achieve greater numbers of DevOps project approvals compared to other methods.

  **Continuous improvement** – Competitive forces and industry trends require that DevOps solutions continue to evolve to keep up with enterprise requirements.

### The Human Element
  Qualities of a DevOps Engineer

  **DevOps engineering** – The development of DevOps engineer roles, skills and the structure of DevOps engineering within an organization is critical to the success of designing, building, maintaining and evolving DevOps solutions.

  **Continuous learning** – A DevOps continuous learning strategy is critical for the development and transfer of DevOps knowledge needed to develop and continuously improve DevOps for the enterprise.

  Depending on your organization, building a DevOps practice can be difficult. The benefits outweigh the challenges. A framework
  that achieves a high performance engineering organization and a consistent relationship with the business is worth implementing.
