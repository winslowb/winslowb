# Summary
  I'm generally ok with this assessment. What it doesn't reflect, is my *awareness*  of needing to be *very self aware*. In other words I play nicely with everyone.

  *William, one of the words that best describes people with your D style is driven. You probably prefer to have variety and forward momentum. Because of this, you may become bored or restless if forced to slow down for too long. Sitting still may be difficult for you. When you reach your goals, you may not always take time to celebrate. Instead, your attention tends to quickly shift to the next goal.*
  
  *You probably like to get things out the door quickly, and you may emphasize results over how you get there. Consequently, you’re probably willing to question the rules if you think they don’t make sense. And when you sense something is wrong, you may do whatever it takes to save the situation. At times, you may fail to realize that this forceful approach can be stressful for the people around you.*

  *People with the D style have little patience for small talk, and you may grow restless listening for long periods without the opportunity to speak. You probably dislike working with people whom you see as incompetent, and it may be hard for you to hide your annoyance at times. When you get really upset, you may let your irritation show in your body language and facial expressions.* 

  *You have a fairly strong competitive side, and at times, you may be fueled by disagreements or conflict. In fact, the idea of losing is probably more upsetting to you than it is to most people. You may suspect that people are driven by self-interest and will take advantage of you if you let them. Consequently, you’re unlikely to take kind words at face value, tending to look for the intentions behind them.* 
  
  *You tend to speak up when you see a problem, even when no one else will. And although you may realize that others can be taken aback by your directness, you’re probably unwilling to compromise what you see as honesty. Because you can be fairly intense, others may sometimes feel that you’re irritated with them.* 
 
  *Although everyone questions their decisions from time to time, you probably do it less often than most people. Those with the D style usually exude self-confidence. This can be infectious, allowing other people to feel good about your bold plans. However, your belief in your opinions may make it difficult for you to admit that you sometimes need to depend on others.* 

  *Like others with the D style, you probably like to be in charge. At times, you may even take control over projects where authority was meant to be divided, alienating some people. This is particularly true when you feel that others are not competent to carry out your vision or don’t see it as clearly as you do. When there is no question that you are in command, you may encourage input, but you may disregard those opinions that conflict with your ideas. Once you’ve had your say in the important decisions, however, you may be more than willing to delegate.* 

  *William, like others with the D style, your most valuable contributions to the workplace may include your drive to get results, your tendency toward bold action, and your willingness to challenge assumptions. In fact, these are probably some of the qualities that others admire most about you.*
