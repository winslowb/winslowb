## Introduction

Your health and well being is the most important thing in the world. I will always index on this fact.

This document is an intro to the way I work, my psychological and operational framework. It will be successful if it aids in building a better working relationship. I'm aware that all of our experiences predicate this moment and determines our leadership and engagement style.

I struggle writing '*I*' and '*me*' as many times as I do in this file. Writing in the first person is uncomfortable as I prefer pronouns like '*us*' and '*we*'. I tend not to use the word '*feel*' and choose words like '*perceive*', '*relative*' and '*reality*' instead. It's kind of quirky but you deserve to know this about me.

### Communication

I cherish different perspectives, thoughts and approaches. When we engage each other, I will prioritize listening over speaking. 
I respect your time and effort to read my communications. While writing I prefer efficiency and simplicity and choose a declarative style of writing out of this respect. When possible, I limit using words when numbers are more appropriate. When using slack, I'm less formal. I'm aware of the disruptive nature instant messaging and don't expect immediate responses. I'll use words like '*ping me when you get a sec*'. If there is urgency I'll use the appropriate adjectives.  

### Engagement
I want you to work autonomously. I'm here to help, provide instruction and direction as needed, but I expect you to build that muscle as we continue our journey together. 

I consider how I approach work as engagement. I will seek tasks - 
* That I'm accountable for 
* That improves a process, decision  
* That provides a path forward
