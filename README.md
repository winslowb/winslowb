 My name is Bill, I like running and biking

___________________________________________

Your health, family and well-being are essential. I will always index on this fact.

This document is an intro to the way I work, my [psychological](https://github.com/winslowb/winslowb/blob/master/disc.md) and [operational](https://github.com/winslowb/winslowb/blob/master/DevOps-principles.md) framework. It will be successful if it aids in building a better working relationship. I'm aware that all of our experiences predicate this moment and determines our leadership and engagement style.

I struggle writing '*I*' and '*me*' as many times as I do in this file. Writing in the first person is uncomfortable as I prefer pronouns like '*us*' and '*we*'. I tend not to use '*feel*' and choose words like '*perceive*', '*relative*' and '*reality*' instead. It's kind of quirky but you deserve to know this about me.

### Communication
I cherish different perspectives, thoughts and approaches. When we engage each other, I will prioritize listening over speaking.

I respect your time and effort reading my communications. [While writing I prefer efficiency and simplicity](https://medium.com/fact-of-the-day-1/amazon-writing-style-tip-a349b4bd3839) and choose a declarative style of writing out of this respect. When possible, I limit using words when numbers are more appropriate. When using slack, I'm less formal. I'm aware of the disruptive nature of instant messaging and don't expect immediate responses. I'll use words like '*ping me when you get a sec*'. If there is urgency I'll use the appropriate adjectives. 

### Engagement
I want you to work autonomously. I'm here to help, provide instruction and direction as needed, but I expect you to build that muscle as we continue our journey together. When it comes to communicating our priorities and objectives, I prefer the use of a RACI filter. We will always consult and inform each other and review what we are responsible and accountable for. 

I consider how I approach work as engagement. I will seek tasks -
* That I'm accountable for
* That improves a process, decision
* That provides a path forward

### Alignment
I seek alignment rather than consensus. Respectful descent is always welcome and I'm willing to let go and of my position and try something new. Once a group decision has been made, I back it 110%. Alignment in spite of differences is a good indicator of a healthy leadership team.

### My Job
As a Leader, I'm measured by:
* Meeting expectations of my title and job description
* Mentoring and Coaching others insuring their success
* Setting clear expectations of others to be successful
* Enact principles that build on a "yes‚Äù mindset
* Facilitating the ideas of [DevOps](https://github.com/winslowb/winslowb/blob/master/DevOps-principles.md) 
* Identifying whats best for the business and whats best for my teams
* Recruiting quality engineers and leaders that further the mission of the business and to make it the best place to work in the world.

I believe my primary mandate in this role is to serve those on my team, including my peers and leadership, not the other way around.  I provide air cover, perspective, experience and constraints that better equip engineers to do their job.
