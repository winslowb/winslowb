## Purpose

This document outlines my psychological and operational frameworks. It's meant to foster better working relationships and provide clarity on how I approach my role. I believe that understanding each other's styles and expectations is key to effective collaboration.

## Communication

I value diverse perspectives and prioritize listening. I strive for clear and concise communication, respecting your time and effort. When writing, I prefer a declarative style, focusing on efficiency and simplicity. On platforms like Slack, I maintain a more informal tone and do not expect immediate responses.

For more on my communication style, see [Amazon Writing Style Tip](https://medium.com/fact-of-the-day-1/amazon-writing-style-tip-a349b4bd3839).

## Engagement

Autonomy is important to me. I support and guide as needed but encourage team members to build their decision-making muscles. I use the RACI model to communicate priorities and objectives, ensuring clear accountability and responsibility.

## Alignment

I seek alignment, not consensus. Respectful dissent is welcome, as it often leads to better outcomes. Once a decision is made, I fully support it. A healthy leadership team thrives on alignment despite differences.

## Leadership Philosophy

As a leader, my role is to serve my team, peers, and leadership. I focus on:
- Meeting job expectations
- Mentoring and coaching for success
- Setting clear expectations
- Fostering a "yes" mindset
- Promoting DevOps principles
- Identifying the best outcomes for the business and my team
- Recruiting talented engineers and leaders

My mandate is to provide air cover and equip engineers with the necessary tools and guidance.
